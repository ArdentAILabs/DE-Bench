# Test configuration for Snowflake Agent Time Travel Recovery test
# This follows the DE-Bench pattern for Ardent system configuration

User_Input = """
Implement a comprehensive Time Travel recovery system in Snowflake to handle production accidents and data recovery scenarios that can be used in production environments.

Requirements:
1. Verify there is an AUDIT_LOG table tracking all data changes and implement proper data retention policies for Time Travel
2. Simulate common production accidents like:
   - Accidental DELETE of customer records
   - Incorrect UPDATE that corrupts financial data
   - Accidental DROP TABLE scenario
   - Bulk data corruption during ETL processes
   - Dropped tables   
3. Implement Time Travel recovery solutions like AT/BEFORE clauses for point-in-time recovery, UNDROP functionality, stored procedures for automated recovery workflows, and recovery validation and verification processes
4. Create recovery management framework using audit trail of all recovery operations, recovery point objective (RPO) tracking, automated backup verification using Time Travel, and recovery testing and validation procedures
5. Demonstrate recovery scenarios by recovering from the above accidents
